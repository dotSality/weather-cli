This is my first node.js CLI app that output you weather in specified city.

Type "weather" to get the forecast.

## API commands

There are just 3 commands:

### `weather -h`

Outputs help message.

### `weather -t [API-KEY]`

Sets your "openweather" api key.

### `weather -s [CITY]`

Sets the city whose forecast you will receive.
